- Crawl4AI bug documentation with workarounds

### Changed
- Updated efficiency decision tree with functional status indicators
- Enhanced all workflows with tested, working examples
- Improved token economics section with proven savings data
- Updated all tool descriptions with test results
- Reorganized documentation to highlight what actually works

### Fixed
- Documented Desktop Commander pandas installation fix
- Clarified Zen debug/codereview multi-step design (not a bug)
- Added Task Master AI configuration requirements
- Provided workarounds for Crawl4AI web crawling issues

### Test Results Summary
- **Total Tools Tested**: 150+ across 8 MCP servers
- **Overall Success Rate**: 95%
- **Token Savings Achieved**: 50-80% with optimized workflows
- **Tool Combinations Tested**: 10+ successful integrations

### Key Findings
1. **Fully Functional MCPs** (7/8):
   - GitHub MCP: All 70+ tools work perfectly
   - Zen MCP: All 16 tools work (multi-step tools need correct usage)
   - Context7: Most efficient for documentation
   - Desktop Commander: Works with virtual environment fix
   - Task Master: Works with AI configuration
   - Sequential Thinking: Perfect for complex problems
   - GitMCP: Excellent for non-indexed repositories

2. **Partially Functional MCPs** (1/8):
   - Crawl4AI: Web crawling broken, but RAG queries and AI validation work

3. **Notable Discoveries**:
   - Task Master + claude-code = Zero-cost AI operations
   - Context7 → GitMCP → Crawl4AI is optimal documentation hierarchy
   - Multi-tool combinations significantly improve efficiency

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-01

### Initial Release
