## Token Usage Analysis

### Efficiency Comparison Table

| Operation | Efficient Method | Tokens | Inefficient Method | Tokens | Savings |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|---------|---------|
| Read React docs | Context7 | 3k | Zen research | 18k | 83% |
| Find file pattern | DC ripgrep | 1k | Read all files | 25k | 96% |
| Create PR | GitHub MCP | 2k | Multiple git cmds | 8k | 75% |
| Debug issue | Zen (targeted) | 8k | Manual exploration | 20k | 60% |

### Cumulative Savings
